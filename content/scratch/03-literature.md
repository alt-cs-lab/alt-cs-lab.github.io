This lesson involves adapting a book into a virtual stage production using  Scratch. Developing an adaptation requires students to closely study the original work, and consider the implications of the new medium and how that will change aspects of the work. It also encourages the development of abstract, causal, and temporal reasoning, utilizes teamwork in small team and whole-class settings, and emphasizes revision and critique in writing, as well as developing 21st century literacy skills.

This lesson serves as a good introduction to creating a Scratch play, which can then be expanded upon to tackle a grade-specific work of literature.
