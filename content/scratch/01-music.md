This lesson introduces Scratch programming by challenging students to teach Scratch to perform Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy”. It also helps students to understand the mathematical background of musical notation and develop skills in counting &amp; cardinality, algebraic operations, temporal reasoning, abstract thinking, and mathematical modelling.

This lesson is appropriate for all ages, but is especially useful for students learning to read music.
