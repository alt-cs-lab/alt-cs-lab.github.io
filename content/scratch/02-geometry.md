This lesson is primarily reinforcement for geometric shape knowledge. It also encourages the development of mathematical thinking and modelling skills, and provides an opportunity to apply shape knowledge in a hands-on manner. It embodies all of the Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice. And, it introduces a number of Scratch blocks and programming practices that can be reused in future student endeavors.

This lesson was specifically targeted for 3rd Grade, but can easily be adapted for other levels.
