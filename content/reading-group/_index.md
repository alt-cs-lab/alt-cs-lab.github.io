  * The presenter will prepare a mock paper review using the template provided and share that with the group at the beginning of the reading group meeting. 
  * The presenter will also prepare a 10-15 minute presentation that summarizes the paper, explains any relevant background knowledge required, and starts the discussion. 
  * The presenter will lead the discussion by posing questions and inviting comments attendees.

* _What is the structure of a reading group meeting?_
  * 5-10 minutes to review the paper and read the mock review provided by the presenter.
  * 10-15 minutes of presentation from the presenter (questions/comments are welcome during the presentation)
  * Remainder of the time for discussion and comments
  * Save 5 minutes at the end to brainstorm research questions or future work for the lab inspired by this paper

## Summer 2023 Papers

### 6/9/2023 - Ahadi & Lister (2013) {#U23-1}

###### Geek genes, prior knowledge, stumbling points and learning edge momentum: parts of the one elephant?

* [Paper Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2493394.2493416)

**Abstract**

> Computing academics report bimodal grade distributions in their CS1 classes. Some academics believe that such a distribution is due to their being an innate talent for programming, a "geek gene". Robins introduced the concept of learning edge momentum, which offers an alternative explanation for the purported bimodal grade distribution. In this paper, we analyze empirical data from a real introductory programming class, looking for evidence of geek genes, learning edge momentum and other possible factors.

###### CS0 vs. CS1: Understanding Fears and Confidence amongst Non-majors in Introductory CS Courses

**Abstract**

> Previous research has been devoted to improving the experience of non-majors in introductory CS courses. In this study, we compare the experiences of non-majors in two different introductory CS courses, specifically with respect to fears about taking the course and change in confidence levels. CS0 is a computing course intentionally designed for non-majors, and CS1 is a more traditional introductory computing course. Both of these courses were composed primarily of non-majors and were taught by the same instructor. Survey data was collected from 124 students enrolled in CS0, and 502 students enrolled in CS1. Through qualitative analysis, we found that the fears of non-major students entering both of these introductory CS courses fell into one or more of nine distinct categories (e.g., Coding, Perceiving STEM as Difficult, Managing Workload). Additionally, using students' confidence levels at the beginning and end of the courses, we found that students in CS0 had a greater increase in confidence level than those in CS1. Finally, we explored connections between students' fears and how their confidence changed by the end of the course. We found that students across both courses with fears related to coding, lack of preparation, and being left behind had the highest average increase in confidence levels.
