## Summer 2023 Papers

### 6/9/2023 - Ahadi & Lister (2013) {#U23-1}

###### Geek genes, prior knowledge, stumbling points and learning edge momentum: parts of the one elephant?

* [Paper Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2493394.2493416)
* [Review](files/summer2023/1-ahadi_lister-2013.pdf)
* [Slides](files/summer2023/1-ahadi_lister-2013.pptx)

**Abstract**

> Computing academics report bimodal grade distributions in their CS1 classes. Some academics believe that such a distribution is due to their being an innate talent for programming, a "geek gene". Robins introduced the concept of learning edge momentum, which offers an alternative explanation for the purported bimodal grade distribution. In this paper, we analyze empirical data from a real introductory programming class, looking for evidence of geek genes, learning edge momentum and other possible factors.

### 6/16/2023 - Hogan, Li & Soosai Raj (2023) {#U23-2}

###### CS0 vs. CS1: Understanding Fears and Confidence amongst Non-majors in Introductory CS Courses

* [Paper Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569865)
* [Review](files/summer2023/2-hogan_li_soosai_raj.pdf)
* [Slides](files/summer2023/2-hogan_li_soosai_raj.pptx)

**Abstract**

> Previous research has been devoted to improving the experience of non-majors in introductory CS courses. In this study, we compare the experiences of non-majors in two different introductory CS courses, specifically with respect to fears about taking the course and change in confidence levels. CS0 is a computing course intentionally designed for non-majors, and CS1 is a more traditional introductory computing course. Both of these courses were composed primarily of non-majors and were taught by the same instructor. Survey data was collected from 124 students enrolled in CS0, and 502 students enrolled in CS1. Through qualitative analysis, we found that the fears of non-major students entering both of these introductory CS courses fell into one or more of nine distinct categories (e.g., Coding, Perceiving STEM as Difficult, Managing Workload). Additionally, using students' confidence levels at the beginning and end of the courses, we found that students in CS0 had a greater increase in confidence level than those in CS1. Finally, we explored connections between students' fears and how their confidence changed by the end of the course. We found that students across both courses with fears related to coding, lack of preparation, and being left behind had the highest average increase in confidence levels.

###### Examining the Digital Divide between Rural and Urban Schools: Technology Availability, Teachers’ Integration Level and Students’ Perception

* [Paper Link](https://www.sciedu.ca/journal/index.php/jct/article/view/3512)
* [Review](files/summer2023/3-wang-review.pdf)
* [Slides](files/summer2023/3-wang-slides.pptx)

**Abstract**

> This study aimed to explore the gap regarding technology integration between urban and rural schools based on theWill Skill Tool model. This study was guided by three main questions: 1) Is there any significant difference in terms of technology availability between rural and urban elementary schools?; 2) Is there any significant difference in terms of teachers’ attitudes, competence, levels and experiences in technology integration between rural and urban elementary schools?; 3) Is there any significant difference in terms of students’ attitudes, competence and experiences in technology integration between rural and urban elementary schools? This was a survey study with 275 teachers and 293 students as participants in southern Taiwan. Half of the participants came from regular urban schools and the other half were from disadvantaged rural schools. T-tests and Chi-Square tests were done to examine differences. The results showed that there was a significant difference in technology availability between rural and urban schools, including the number of interactive whiteboards, desktops in labs, notebooks, netbooks, and tablet computers. There was also a difference in teacher overall high-tech integration level between rural and urban schools.Urban teachers reached the level of “familiarity and confidence” but rural teachers only stayed at the level of“understanding and application of the process.” Teachers’ experience, purpose and difficulty in technology integration between rural and urban schools were also slightly different. In addition, there was a difference in students’ experience and preference in using technology to learn, especially using interactive whiteboards in learning.

### 7/7/2023 - Utting et al. (2013) {#U23-4}

###### A Fresh Look at Novice Programmers' Performance and their Teachers' Expectations

* [Paper Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2543882.2543884)
* [Review](files/summer2023/4-utting-review.pdf)
* [Slides](files/summer2023/4-utting-slides.pptx)

**Abstract**

> This paper describes the results of an ITiCSE working group convened in 2013 to review and revisit the influential ITiCSE 2001 McCracken working group that reported on novice programmers' ability to solve a specified programming problem. Like that study, the one described here asked students to implement a simple program. Unlike the original study, students' in this study were given significant scaffolding for their efforts, including a test harness. Their knowledge of programming concepts was also assessed via a standard language-neutral survey. One of the significant findings of the original working group was that students were less successful at the programming task than their teachers expected, so in this study teachers' expectations were explicitly gathered and matched with students' performance. This study found a significant correlation between students' performance in the practical task and the survey, and a significant effect on performance in the practical task attributable to the use of the test harness. The study also found a much better correlation between teachers' expectations of their students' performance than in the 2001 working group.
