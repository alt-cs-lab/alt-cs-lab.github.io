## Summer 2023 Papers

### 6/9/2023 - Ahadi & Lister (2013) {#U23-1}

###### Geek genes, prior knowledge, stumbling points and learning edge momentum: parts of the one elephant?

* [Paper Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2493394.2493416)
* [Review](files/summer2023/1-ahadi_lister-2013.pdf)
* [Slides](files/summer2023/1-ahadi_lister-2013.pptx)

**Abstract**

> Computing academics report bimodal grade distributions in their CS1 classes. Some academics believe that such a distribution is due to their being an innate talent for programming, a "geek gene". Robins introduced the concept of learning edge momentum, which offers an alternative explanation for the purported bimodal grade distribution. In this paper, we analyze empirical data from a real introductory programming class, looking for evidence of geek genes, learning edge momentum and other possible factors.

###### CS0 vs. CS1: Understanding Fears and Confidence amongst Non-majors in Introductory CS Courses

* [Paper Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569865)
* [Review](files/summer2023/2-hogan_li_soosai_raj.pdf)
* [Slides](files/summer2023/2-hogan_li_soosai_raj.pptx)

**Abstract**

> Previous research has been devoted to improving the experience of non-majors in introductory CS courses. In this study, we compare the experiences of non-majors in two different introductory CS courses, specifically with respect to fears about taking the course and change in confidence levels. CS0 is a computing course intentionally designed for non-majors, and CS1 is a more traditional introductory computing course. Both of these courses were composed primarily of non-majors and were taught by the same instructor. Survey data was collected from 124 students enrolled in CS0, and 502 students enrolled in CS1. Through qualitative analysis, we found that the fears of non-major students entering both of these introductory CS courses fell into one or more of nine distinct categories (e.g., Coding, Perceiving STEM as Difficult, Managing Workload). Additionally, using students' confidence levels at the beginning and end of the courses, we found that students in CS0 had a greater increase in confidence level than those in CS1. Finally, we explored connections between students' fears and how their confidence changed by the end of the course. We found that students across both courses with fears related to coding, lack of preparation, and being left behind had the highest average increase in confidence levels.

###### Examining the Digital Divide between Rural and Urban Schools: Technology Availability, Teachers’ Integration Level and Students’ Perception

* [Review](files/summer2023/3-wang-review.pdf)
* [Slides](files/summer2023/3-wang-slides.pptx)

**Abstract**

> This study aimed to explore the gap regarding technology integration between urban and rural schools based on theWill Skill Tool model. This study was guided by three main questions: 1) Is there any significant difference in terms of technology availability between rural and urban elementary schools?; 2) Is there any significant difference in terms of teachers’ attitudes, competence, levels and experiences in technology integration between rural and urban elementary schools?; 3) Is there any significant difference in terms of students’ attitudes, competence and experiences in technology integration between rural and urban elementary schools? This was a survey study with 275 teachers and 293 students as participants in southern Taiwan. Half of the participants came from regular urban schools and the other half were from disadvantaged rural schools. T-tests and Chi-Square tests were done to examine differences. The results showed that there was a significant difference in technology availability between rural and urban schools, including the number of interactive whiteboards, desktops in labs, notebooks, netbooks, and tablet computers. There was also a difference in teacher overall high-tech integration level between rural and urban schools.Urban teachers reached the level of “familiarity and confidence” but rural teachers only stayed at the level of“understanding and application of the process.” Teachers’ experience, purpose and difficulty in technology integration between rural and urban schools were also slightly different. In addition, there was a difference in students’ experience and preference in using technology to learn, especially using interactive whiteboards in learning.

###### A Fresh Look at Novice Programmers' Performance and their Teachers' Expectations

* [Review](files/summer2023/4-utting-review.pdf)
* [Slides](files/summer2023/4-utting-slides.pptx)

**Abstract**

> This paper describes the results of an ITiCSE working group convened in 2013 to review and revisit the influential ITiCSE 2001 McCracken working group that reported on novice programmers' ability to solve a specified programming problem. Like that study, the one described here asked students to implement a simple program. Unlike the original study, students' in this study were given significant scaffolding for their efforts, including a test harness. Their knowledge of programming concepts was also assessed via a standard language-neutral survey. One of the significant findings of the original working group was that students were less successful at the programming task than their teachers expected, so in this study teachers' expectations were explicitly gathered and matched with students' performance. This study found a significant correlation between students' performance in the practical task and the survey, and a significant effect on performance in the practical task attributable to the use of the test harness. The study also found a much better correlation between teachers' expectations of their students' performance than in the 2001 working group.

###### CS1 Students' Perspectives on the Computer Science Gender Gap: Achieving Equity Requires Awareness

**Abstract**

> There are numerous initiatives to improve diversity within the computer science field. However, women still disproportionately drop CS majors and earn less than one quarter of CS bachelor's degrees in the United States. The extent to which CS students-especially male students-are aware of this gender gap is an open question. This paper reports on a study to investigate that question. We analyzed 325 CS1 students' survey responses and found significant differences between women's and men's awareness of the CS gender gap. Men were significantly less aware of the gender gap than women, and men had significantly milder beliefs about whether women experienced adversity in CS and whether there should be targeted efforts to support women. Twenty students (10 women and 10 men) participated in follow-up interviews after the survey, where they discussed their experiences and perceptions of the computer science gender gap. Even among students who were aware of the gender gap, many had a superficial understanding of its cause, believing it to be due to women having less natural interest in CS. We argue that these findings are a call-to-action: university CS curricula need to include diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training so that students have a more complete understanding of this complex issue, and so that these misconceptions do not continue to be perpetuated into the workplace.

###### Students' Initial Course Motivation and Their Achievement and Retention in College CS1 Courses

* [Review](files/summer2023/6-shell-review.pdf)
* [Slides](files/summer2023/6-shell-slides.pptx)

**Abstract**

> The goal of this study was to investigate how students' entering motivation for the course in a suite of CS1 introductory computer science courses was associated with their subsequent course achievement and retention. Courses were tailored for specific student populations (CS majors, engineering majors, business-CS combined honors program). Students' goal orientations (learning, performance, task), perceived instrumentality (endogenous, exogenous), career connectedness, self-efficacy, and mindsets (growth or fixed) were assessed at the start of the course. Grades were significantly predicted from entering motivation; but prediction was highly variable across courses, ranging from not predicted for the engineering courses to highly predictable for the business-CS honors program. Course withdrawal was significantly predicted. Likelihood of withdrawing was decreased by future time career connectedness and learning approach goal orientation and increased by having an incremental theory of intelligence. Findings suggest that CS1 students who set learning approach goals for their classes have better academic outcomes and higher retention. Other motivational beliefs were inconsistent in their impacts and varied by course and student population. Except for students in an honors program, entering motivational beliefs weakly predicted achievement and retention, suggesting that impacts of the course itself on motivation and how motivation changes during the course are perhaps more important than student's initial motivation.
