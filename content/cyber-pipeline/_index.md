The Cyber Pipeline Initiative seeks to broaden participation in computing by assisting Kansas K-12 schools in bringing quality computer science instruction to __all__ Kansas students.  Computational thinking and programming are recognized as critical 21st century skills for every career, as the transformative impact of computer technology has come to bear on every aspect of our lives. Wether it be authoring original software, using data mining techniques to analyze the genome of a new bovine virus, creating computer models of the watersheds that recharge the Ogallala aquifer, or programming a drone to overfly a wheat field to assess hail damage, the techniques and skills of computer science have role to play in all Kansans' lives. 

The Cyber Pipeline provides a complete - but customizable - Computer Science curriculum for Kansas schools. The curriculum was created by computer science and curriculum development experts at Kansas State University, and includes high-quality video lectures, engaging interactive programming exercises, and can be taught for college credit through the Advanced Placement exams.  It is delivered through an online platform that runs in the browser on a school's current PCs, Macs, and Chromebooks. The entire curriculum is published under Creative Commons license, allowing teachers and schools to adapt the curriculum materials to suit their students' needs. 

Since our full rollout in the 2022-23 academic year, 50+ teachers received free training and graduate credits to teach computer science and are reaching over 2,000 students in 41 school districts across the state!
