Currently the Cyber Pipeline is offering two introductory computer science courses appropriate for Kansas high schools:

* __CC110 - Introduction to Computing__
  This course introduces students to the field of computing, including its history, development, hardware, and the basics of programming in Python.  It is aligned with the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles course, which allows schools teaching the class to offer the corresponding AP exam.
* __CC210 - Fundamental Computer Programming Concepts__ This course teaches the foundational concepts of structured imperative programming using the Java language.  It is aligned with the Advanced Placement Computer Science A course, which allows schools to offer the corresponding AP exam.
