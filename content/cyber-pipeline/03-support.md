We have found a critical factor in the success of new computer science teachers is comprehensive support throughout both professional development coursework and in the first few years of teaching. We meet this need in multiple ways:

1. The College of Engineering at Kansas State University has funded a helpdesk staffed by knowledgable Computer Science students (both graduate and undergraduate) who can answer many questions Cyber Pipeline teachers and students may have. 
2. The faculty involved in the Cyber Pipeline program are committed to providing fast and helpful responses to Cyber Pipeline teacher's concerns and questions. 
3. The Department of Computer Science at Kansas State University has committed to hosting an annual Kansas CSTA Chapter Conference, where Kansas K-12 teachers and meet, share ideas, and help set the agenda for improvements to the Cyber Pipeline and other outreach efforts.
