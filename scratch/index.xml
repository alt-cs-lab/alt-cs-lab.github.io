      <description>This lesson introduces Scratch programming by challenging students to teach Scratch to perform Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy”. It also helps students to understand the mathematical background of musical notation and develop skills in counting &amp;amp; cardinality, algebraic operations, temporal reasoning, abstract thinking, and mathematical modelling.
This lesson is appropriate for all ages, but is especially useful for students learning to read music.
Final Program Example Files All files (including editable docx versions): Music.</description>

      <description>This lesson is primarily reinforcement for geometric shape knowledge. It also encourages the development of mathematical thinking and modelling skills, and provides an opportunity to apply shape knowledge in a hands-on manner. It embodies all of the Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice. And, it introduces a number of Scratch blocks and programming practices that can be reused in future student endeavors.
This lesson was specifically targeted for 3rd Grade, but can easily be adapted for other levels.</description>

      <title>Literature Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://alt-cs-lab.github.io/scratch/literature/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://alt-cs-lab.github.io/scratch/literature/index.html</guid>
      <description>This lesson involves adapting a book into a virtual stage production using Scratch. Developing an adaptation requires students to closely study the original work, and consider the implications of the new medium and how that will change aspects of the work. It also encourages the development of abstract, causal, and temporal reasoning, utilizes teamwork in small team and whole-class settings, and emphasizes revision and critique in writing, as well as developing 21st century literacy skills.</description>
